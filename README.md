# Kitspace Partinfo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/monostable/kitnic-partinfo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/monostable/kitnic-partinfo)

A microservice to get information on electronic components. This is used on [kitspace.org](https://kitspace.org) to get the part information for the BOM popups.

This is a [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) API, the schema is detailed in [schema.js](src/schema.js). Currently it is simply a subset and re-arrangement of the information retrieved from the [Octopart API](https://octopart.com/api/home) but additional API backends or web scraping could be added in the future.
